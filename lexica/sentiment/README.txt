A collection of sentiment lexica, each containing a file 'negatives.txt' and 'positive.txt'.
A sentiment lexica must contain these two files, but either can be used as a single signal lexicon as well.

Sentiment lexica are useful for unsupervised sentiment regression by simply defining a distance metric
between two lexica: positive words, and negative words. And further, defining a mapping from documents
or other language repsentations to a vector space.
