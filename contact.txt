Datasets are available on request.

I have full digital content datasets available for most major online news platforms, and can acquired additional ones on request. A few
oddball organizations in other languages.

Language data consists of synopsis info as one might get from the facebook graph api for a specific content item (by url): title/headline and description.
Some data contains full language info, such as full article text. It depends on how an organization stored their content in the graph, but most use
the same format of title + description (~150 words usually). Engagement data includes only facebook share counts, but other academic datasets are available
for share-regression tasks (Shorenstein Center data for example).

All content data is derived from openly available archive api's and social media api's, and is protected by fair-use for research/criticism purposes.

100+ available full-content datasets for national, local, and foreign orgs:
	-novayagazeta 2013-2018
	-foxnews 2013-2018
	-cnn 2010-2018
	-nbc 2013-2017
	-google news 2011-2018
	-yahoo news 2014-2018
	-msn 2014-2018
	-abc 2014-2018
	-bbc
	-npr
	-sputnik
	-russia today
	...you get the idea. A lot.

All datasets are 2-32GB in size, much too large to post on most sites.

All available free of charge to formal researchers under fair-use.
